# Textagram: 
- Built Social Media Platform from end to end taking complete ownership of entire web application

### Features: [Website](https://textagram-one.vercel.app/) | [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MbgWdafc6Y&t=6s&ab_channel=PassionateProgrammer)
- Designed with React.js for rich responsive user interface experience
- Implemented different roles to users such as admin role and regular user role
- Allowed admin accounts to be able to have controls over website, such as admin can delete users' posts and comments, and editing people's posts and profiles.
- Allowed users to give upvoting and downvoting each post so users can filter a post since people would post anonymously. This feature would prevent any toxicity in the website. More negative votes on a post, the fonts will fade away.
- Displayed top 5 posts that have most votes currently and top 5 hashtags that are being used the most. These two lists were done by frontend side. I felt I do not have to filter them from backend but on frontend right away. I was able to do them using sorting and/or dictionary. 
- Allowed this website to be responsive as well. If you go there on mobile, you will be able to see that there's a mobile navigation on the screen whereas desktop. 

### Backend: [Github](https://github.com/joowoonk/textagram-be/) | [Heroku](https://textagram-be.herokuapp.com/)
- Built Rest API developed with Node.js and Express
- Connected to PostgreSQL to allow for data persistence
